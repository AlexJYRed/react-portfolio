"aboutpara":"WarGames is a film with a somber message about the dangers of trusting technology that we don't fully understand. When I watched it, I thought, \"Wow, it would be so cool to be a hacker!\" I love coding most when it feels like a puzzle; whether it's a question of literal logic or a subjective question of designing a pleasant user experience, I love the challenge of finding the best solution. I'm a computer science student at Stanford, and I've been lucky enough to work on some really cool projects, from a React budgeting app to a Vue.js landing page. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, so if you have a project you think I'd be a good fit for, I'd love to hear from you!","aboutImage":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1605153864431-a2795a1b2f95?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxjb2xsZWN0aW9uLXBhZ2V8MXwyNTY3ODl8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=400&q=60",
